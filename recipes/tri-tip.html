    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Santa Maria, California, is home to one of America's most delicious barbecue specialties: black-on-the-outside, pink-on-the-inside, grilled beef tri-tip steak.
    The tri-tip is cut from the bottom sirloin, and if cooked properly produces a very flavorful, extremely juicy piece of beef.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) beef tri-tip roast</li>
            <li>⅓ cup red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves crushed garlic</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, rosemary, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Place beef in a glass baking dish and coat beef on all sides with spice mixture. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Combine vinegar, vegetable oil, crushed garlic, and Dijon mustard together in a sealable container. Cover the container and shake to blend ingredients.</li>
            <li>Remove beef from refrigerator, uncover, and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Place meat on preheated grill and brush with garlic-vinegar mixture. Cook meat for 4 minutes, flip, and baste. Repeat the flip and baste process every 4 minutes until beef starts to firm and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 25 to 30 minutes total. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Let rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
